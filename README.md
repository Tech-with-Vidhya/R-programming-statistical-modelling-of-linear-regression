# R-programming-statistical-modelling-of-linear-regression

This project is delivered as part of my Masters in Big Data Science (MSc BDS) Program for the module named “Applied Statistics” in Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), London, United Kingdom.  
The project covered the statistical modelling of linear regression machine learning algorithm implemented in R programming for the “njgolf” dataset.  

**NOTE:** Due to the data privacy and the data protection policy to be adhered by the students; the datasets and the solution related code are not exposed and updated in the GitHub public profile; in order to be compliant with the Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) policies.
